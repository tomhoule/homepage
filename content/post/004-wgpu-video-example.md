I had free time yesterday,so I continued my efforts to find a better creative
coding setup. What came out of it is [the
tomhoule/wgpu-minimal-video-rendering-example GitHub
repo](https://github.com/tomhoule/wgpu-minimal-video-rendering-example).

I like how working on this feels: with `mold`, iteration time is pretty fast
(recompilation + rendering and enconding in a < 5 seconds on my old laptop),
and the artifacts are easy to share. It feels solid.

If you're interested in this, just have a look at the repo. There is a bit more
content in the README.
