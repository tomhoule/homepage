This is a follow up to [a first post](/intro/), where I wrote down my
impressions as I just started working on the problems from Michael Spivak's
[_Calculus_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/328645.Calculus) (3rd ed.) with the Lean theorem prover.

A few months later, [I finished writing Lean proofs for all the problems in chapter 1](https://github.com/tomhoule/spivak-calculus/).

After the expected period of familiarization with Lean and
mathlib, what I hoped for is what happened: **at this point, for the problems I
am solving, the hard part is the maths, not the theorem prover**.

- The Zulip channel is extremely valuable
- Read mathlib code
- Writing down the problem is sometimes the hardest part: problem 1 c, problem
  24 c.
- At this point, what I hoped for happened: the hard part is the maths, not the
  lean.
- Using real instead of a type class
