I intend to try and keep this list up-to-date as I make progress on the topic.

Jean-Yves Girard, _Le fantôme de la transparence_ (2017)

With a minimum of familiarity with logic, it's accessible, extremely funny at times, pointed, beautifully exposed and a great way to take a step back and see linear logic in its broader context. A real joy to read.

I don't know how well some of the cultural references would translate out of a French context though — writing this as a native speaker.

Jean-Yves Girard, _Le Point Aveugle, Cours de logique I — Vers la perfection_ (2006)

Most of the book is accessible with a relatively shallow logic background. It can be read as a high level view of developments in modern logic since Frege, with a progression from classical logic to intuitionistic logic, to computability theory, type theory, category theory and linear logic.

While this is clearly very much Girard's perspective and it naturally leads to linear logic, it is full of juicy insights. I enjoyed it very much, but got stuck on the [Coherent Spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherent_space) chapter. At this point, I think more mathematical maturity is required.

Torben Braüner, [Introduction to Linear Logic](https://www.brics.dk/LS/96/6/BRICS-LS-96-6.pdf) (1996)

A nice high level view of a few important results and variants of linear logic.
