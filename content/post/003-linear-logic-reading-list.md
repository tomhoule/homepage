Jean-Yves Girard, _Le fantôme de la transparence_ (2017)

With a minimum of familiarity with logic, it's accessible, extremely funny at times, pointed, beautifully exposed and a great way to take a step back and see linear logic in its broader context. A real joy to read.

I don't know how well some of the cultural references would translate out of a French context though — writing this as a native speaker.
