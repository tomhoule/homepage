This is a race report, probably most interesting for myself looking back on it
later, but hey, it's writing practice.

# The race

Yesterday, I ran my first [half-marathon in
Potsdam](https://www.potsdam-schloesserlauf.de/strecke/). It was a sunny day,
around 20°C. I have done the distance in long runs before, so I knew I could
finish if I didn't go out too fast. The A goal was finishing under 2 hours, and
the B goal was finishing with an even or nearly even split, not slowing down
too much towards the end. I ended up finishing in 1:55:04, couldn't be happier.

I found and followed a group in the first half, but ultimately their pace was a
bit too aggressive for me and I fell behind in the hilly trails section around
Babelsberg. Not insisting probably was the right decision.

For pacing after that, I relied on my phone. The GPS tracking (with the
RunKeeper app) wasn't completely in sync with the kilometer signs on the
course, it was off for most of the second half, sometimes too much, sometimes
too little, and 400m too short by the end. The learning is to not take the
average pace in the app too literally.

In the end, my splits were pretty regular, there was a ~20 seconds variability
but that can be explained by pushing harder in the last km and slowing down on
hilly dirt paths towards the middle (Babelsberg and after).

I finished strong and super happy, but obviously exhausted and with tight and
painful glutes and hip flexors.

After the race, we went to Klaistow with the family to buy some baskets and eat
some fresh asparagus. It was delicious but I overdid it on the overall quantity
and the amount of — very buttery — hollandaise sauce. That might have
contributed to the difficulties to come.

# Training

Very briefly: I had a good training block, before and after the 14km RBB Lauf
end of April. I managed to increase my weekly mileage to a bit over 50km
towards the end without injury, despite persistent runner's knee, which got
more manageable with proper calf warm-ups. Most of the runs were very easy,
with weekly long runs that went about half-marathon distance — 22km for the
longest — towards the end. I tried implementing weekly speed workouts
(threshold runs and intervals), but at least half of them did not end up
realizing because of knee pain or insufficient recovery. Making sure I can get
the speed workouts in will be a focus next time I train for a race. I am
planning on just focusing on base building and fun, relaxing runs for the
summer.

# The ugly aftermath

Now the ugly part. I finished the race towards 11, and shortly after started
getting headaches. I had made sure to stay on top of water and sugar intake
with one glass of cola and a half-banana during the race, and right after a
sports drink, another half-banana and an apple, so I don't think it's likely
that I was dehydrated or too low in sugar. As mentioned, lunch was very heavy,
with a bunch of fat, and I had a beer with it, so some alcohol on top. We went
home and I had coffee and some biscuits. The headaches weren't too bad most of
the afternoon so I opted not to take any ibuprofen. But they got much worse
towards 5pm. I took some ibuprofen, and vomited shortly after.

I have no certainty about what happened, but a few hypotheses:

- Too much sun. There was no cloud at all and I was running outside for two
  hours, then walking in the sun after that. I was wearing a hat for the better
  part of it, but there was definitely a lot of exposure.
- I learned about exertion headaches from searching around on the internet in
  the afternoon. I never had these before — that I noticed —, so it's possible
  but doesn't sound that likely. We'll see if that happens again.
- My body was weak from the effort and it didn't tolerate either the amount of
  fat and food in general, or got an indigestion from potentially something
  swimming in the water I picked the asparagus up from.
- Caffeine somehow did not play well with my guts. But again, the headaches
  started before coffee.

# Parting words

All in all a beautiful day with the family, and a very positive first half
marathon experience. Next step is a trail half-marathon, the [Sielmanns
Heidelauf](https://sportverein-dallgow.de/heidelauf/), in the [Döberitzer Heide
reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%B6beritzer_Heide) between Berlin
and Potsdam. I won't be looking for a specific time on that one, just to enjoy
the run and the nature.
