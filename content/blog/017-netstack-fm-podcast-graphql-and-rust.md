I joined Glen on Netstack.fm to chat about the state of GraphQL. We touched on its evolution and dug into technical topics like the N+1 problem, persisted queries, and the the trend of Rust federation gateways.

You can listen to the episode [on the podcast's website](https://netstack.fm/#episode-21).
