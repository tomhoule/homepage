I read a few bookgs on running

# Chi Running

Many cues. Interesting ideas, in particular got me started on thinking more about core activation.

# Older Yet Faster

Cues can be dangerous. This one focuses on a very narrow set of cues and perceptions (stable landing) to avoid overstriding. Very, very focused, and good clues. Also what not to worry about: vertical motion, foot placement, cadence. More controversially too: strength training.

# The Running Revolution

Builds up on the advice from Older Yet Faster and goes into more details. Balanced landing. Also minimalist, stable shoes.

Towards the beginning, goes very in depth on the why and how of keeping a running journal, that convinced me to put in more effort into doing that.

# The Balanced Runner

Became aware of it through Sashen's podcast.

Breathing technique. Very helpful advice on breathing into your lower abdomen when running, I can feel my spine correcting its position.

# Grown and Healthy

Breathing advice (video on correcting posture through hollow belly).
