Trying something out: monthly-ish lists of things I read and liked.

+++

I am starting an experiment: just document interesting things I read as a list
from time to time. It's already the twelvth, vacations are coming up, and I
already did a lot of reading I haven't documented, so I expect this month's
list to be pretty short.

### Graphics

- A blog post, [Physarum, by Sage Jenson](https://sagejenson.com/physarum) — slime mold
  population generation, pretty cool looking.
- Re-read [learn wgpu](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/). Good tutorial!

### Databases & Distributed Systems

- [Don't Get Stuck in the "Con" Game, by Pat
  Helland](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3480470). Deconstruction of the
  notion of consistency and eventual consistency. Proposes more well defined
  notion to know what we talk about when we talk about consistency. A
  potentially useful toolbox for reasoning and exposition.

### Formal Methods

- [Rust verification tools (2021), by Alastair
  Reid](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KlHeawNg4UDzvNLByv7RxYTGTVLBGIdfg8532pfuJKU/edit#heading=h.fugu5ki75pe3).
  Alastair Reid's updated list of automated verification tools for Rust. I've
  been interested for a long time, so not many projects were new, but I learned
  about [shuttle](https://crates.io/crates/shuttle), [the Oxide
  paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00982),
  [hacspec](https://hacspec.github.io/), [SeaHorn](https://seahorn.github.io/) and
  [rust-horn](https://github.com/hopv/rust-horn) from this. The [companion blog
  post](https://alastairreid.github.io/automatic-rust-verification-tools-2021/)
  has interesting sections on the respective weaknesses of abstract
  interpretation, bounded model checkers, dynamic symbolic execution and
  instrumented interpreters like miri.

### Math

- [How real are real numbers? by Gregory Chaitin
  (2004)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0411418.pdf). A very approachable,
  condensed, well exposed high level view of some problematic features fo the
  real numbers, in particular from an intuitionistic perspective (Borel's).
  First from a principle perspective, then linked to a formal perspective with
  the later emergence of computerscience. Good read.

### General blog posts / opinions

- [Query-based
  compilers](https://ollef.github.io/blog/posts/query-based-compilers.html).
  The author draws connections between query-based compilers (examples:
  rust-analyzer, typescript) and the [Build-systems à la
  carte](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/097CE52C750E69BD16B78C318754C7A4/S0956796820000088a.pdf/build-systems-a-la-carte-theory-and-practice.pdf)
  paper. My personal impression is that there's an analogy here with nix as
  well.
