## Nix

- [Developing Nix Libraries with
  Subflakes](https://figsoda.github.io/posts/2023/developing-nix-libraries-with-subflakes/)
  highlights some awkwardness in composing flakes, and separating the public

  the new V1 API looks like a clean solution by departing from recommending the
  flake as the public API. Instead, it's just nix modules to evaluate.
