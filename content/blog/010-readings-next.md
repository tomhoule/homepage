## Nix

- [Developing Nix Libraries with
  Subflakes](https://figsoda.github.io/posts/2023/developing-nix-libraries-with-subflakes/)
  highlights some awkwardness in composing flakes, and separating the public
  from the private (development) dependencies. Dream2nix had that problem â€” but
  the new V1 API looks like a clean solution by departing from recommending the
  flake, with its inputs, as the public API. Instead, it's just nix modules to evaluate.

## Rust

- Rust Atomics and Locks, Mara Bos.

  Learned a few things (if let scope caveat with mutex guards that doesn't happen with ifs, trick for naming cloned arcs before moving them inside closure)

## Politics

- Talk on AI by tante, in German. https://digitalcourage.video/w/51c3a3c7-c502-4321-896d-18c8b3077892

## Running

- Chi Running. Good form advice, finally understood pelvic tilt, argument that makes sense against cushioning (midsole compression takes time, and tends to unnecessarily prolong ground contact). Vague language around muscle vs chi, how muscles can be completely relaxed when running, exaggeration (something like "can guarantee you can run the same you do now at 30% the energy cost"), not convinced by the nutrition chapter. But good cues, good exercises I will definitely take with me. Also exaggerating the trait on "power running" vs chi running.
  - I liked:
      - I like the pendulum part: arms are bent at the elbow, and legs are bent at the knee so the limbs become shorter pendulums that can swing faster.
      - Concrete exercises to work on the lean.
      - Cues from Tai chi are different, good to try (steel and cotton)
      - The pre-run and post-run routines
      - The arm cues: focus on swinging the elbow, not the arm. Don't swing at the shoulder, but rather from your back.
  - Emphasis on relaxation (not stretching!) is likely good
  - Takes one extreme in the debate of whether to push off or not. This book is very much in favour of picking up the foot, without consciously pushing.

- Older yet faster.
  - Different set of cues. For example p66 (OYF rule #7): do not focus on advancing the front foot, but on the back foot catching up with the hips. OYF rule #8 don't control your feet seems at odd with the "pick up your feet" from Chi Running. "Don't try to reduce your overstride by doing faster, shorter steps". Emphasis on running fast, gives you the impression that you will need a full year to relearn how to run, etc.

On both of these, taking some of the advice, but with grains of salt.

- Running with the Kenyans
